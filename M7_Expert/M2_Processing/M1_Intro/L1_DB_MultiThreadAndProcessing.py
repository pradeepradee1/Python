# Multi Threading And Multi Processing both are ways to achieve MultiTasking.


# Difference Between MultiThread And MultiProcessing ?

# Multi Thread
# Create Multiple Thread inside a process
# Multi Thread will share memory space and Each one Has specfic instructions and specfic task
# It gloably to connect with another thread

# Multi Process
# Create Multiple Thread inside a process
# Multi Process has own memory space and Each one has its Interprocessor Communication Techniques (e.g., pipes, sockets)
# By using this technique each process share its data , memory 



# For Example :
# I am Running the Chrome and youtube and VisulStudioCode applications in my machine This is Multi Tasking
# All the Different Programs are Different Process 
# We Can See In The Task Manager in windows

# What is Multiple Thread ?
# Multiple Thread live within same Process

# What is Multiple Process ?
# Process Has its own virtual memory Or Address Space
# It Can Create Multiple Thread inside it




#Key Difference
#Thread Are Light Weight
#Process are Heavy Weight

#Note
#The Benifit of multiprocessing is that  error or Memory leak in process won't hurt another process
